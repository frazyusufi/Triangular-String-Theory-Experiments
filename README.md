# Triangular-String-Theory-Experiments

This repository contains experimental protocols, data simulations, and analytical tools aimed at validating key predictions of the **Triangular-Coupled String Theory (T-CST)**—a novel framework that integrates spacetime geometry, consciousness, and quantum fields via triangular dimensional structures.

## Overview

Triangular-Coupled String Theory (T-CST) introduces a new dimensional model in which spacetime and consciousness co-evolve through a triadic structure of interlinked temporal and scalar fields, denoted as **T₁, T₂, T₃**. This repository supports the theoretical development by providing a bridge between abstract formulations and potential experimental validation strategies.

## Goals

- To simulate 40Hz Φ-resonance using EEG/MEG data, testing triangular consciousness field coupling.
- To analyze decoherence patterns in Bose-Einstein Condensates influenced by triangular field interference.
- To assess particle collision outcomes (e.g., triplet-jet symmetry anomalies) in LHC data under T-CST assumptions.
- To build numerical models of field evolution on triangulated lattices.
- To investigate symmetry, quantization, and anomaly cancellation mechanisms via experiment-informed modeling.

## Repository Structure


## Key Concepts

- **Triangular Field Constraints:**  
  Enforced by \( T_1 + T_2 + T_3 = 0 \), modeling time and consciousness as a closed loop geometry.

- **Φ-field Resonance Hypothesis:**  
  Predicts measurable coherence at 40Hz in meditator brain activity due to alignment with triangular consciousness fields.

- **T-CST Spectrum Deviation:**  
  Proposes extensions to string vibration spectra under influence of triangular dimensions, testable through high-energy collider data.
